//! FRUG is intended to provide a similar abstraction layer over graphics programming as to how SDL does for C++, meaning that it should provide developers enough control and flexibility to implement their own architectures & design patterns, yet simplifying the process of working with graphics so developers won't have to worry about implementing all the repetitive tasks related to getting things to the screen.

//! I'M MIGRATING THIS WHOLE THING FROM WGPU TO SDL3. PLEASE HOLD ON!!!
