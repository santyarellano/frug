# Welcome to the FRUG repo!

In here you will find the source code for the FRUG library.

## About

FRUG is intended to provide a similar abstraction layer over graphics programming as to how Monogame does for C#, meaning that it should provide developers enough control and flexibility to implement their own architectures & design patterns, yet simplifying the process of working with graphics so developers won't have to worry about implementing all the repetitive tasks related to getting things to the screen.

Please check out [the documentation](https://santyarellano.github.io/frug_book/) to learn more about the project and how to use it! (there is also the cargo documentation, but I'm afraid that part is not as polished for now)

> I'm currently migrating this whole thing to work more like what monogame is for C#. So I'm changing this so instead of using WGPU we'll use SDL3 (rust API) and hopefully I'll find some way to make it work with game consoles as well.

> On a side note, please take into account that the project is in it's first iteration and many features are still under development or missing.
